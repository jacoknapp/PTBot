## What is PTBot?

PTBot is a Go-based Discord bot that lets you manage your Pterodactyl servers directly from Discord. Whether you want to start, stop, restart, check status, or send console commands, PTBot has you covered. It's like having a sysadmin in your pocket (or at least in your Discord sidebar).

## Features
- **Slash Commands**: Use `/pt` to list servers, check status, start, stop, restart, or send commands. üí¨
- **Autocomplete**: Server names autocomplete for fast, typo-free ops. üîç
- **Role & User Restrictions**: Only the cool kids (or the ones you allow) can use the bot. üòé
- **Health Checks**: PTBot keeps an eye on your Pterodactyl panel and sends alerts if things go sideways. ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Configurable**: Set up via config file or environment variables. Supports allowlists for guilds, roles, and users.

## Example Commands
- `/pt list` ‚Äì See all your servers üìã
- `/pt status name:<server>` ‚Äì Get server status ü©∫
- `/pt start name:<server>` ‚Äì Start a server ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
- `/pt stop name:<server>` ‚Äì Stop a server ‚èπÔ∏è
- `/pt restart name:<server>` ‚Äì Restart a server üîÑ
- `/pt send name:<server> command:<cmd>` ‚Äì Send a console command üíª

## Setup
1. **Build the bot** (see Dockerfile for details)
2. **Configure** your Discord token, Pterodactyl URL, and other secrets in `/data/config.json` or environment variables.
3. **Invite the bot** to your Discord server.
4. **Profit** (or at least enjoy easier server management).

## Docker & Docker Compose Setup

You can run PTBot easily using Docker or Docker Compose. This is the recommended way for production deployments.

      PTERO_BASE_URL: <your-pterodactyl-url>
      PTERO_CLIENT_TOKEN: <your-pterodactyl-client-api-token>
      ALERT_CHANNEL_ID: <discord-channel-id-for-alerts> #optional

    command: ["-config", "/data/config.json"]
```

## How to Get a Pterodactyl Client API Key

To use PTBot, you'll need a Pterodactyl Client API key. Here's how to get one:

1. **Log in to your Pterodactyl panel** as the user who owns the servers you want to control.
2. Click your profile icon (top right) and select **"API"** from the dropdown menu.
3. Click **"New API Key"**.
4. Enter a name/description for the key (e.g., "PTBot") and set any desired IP restrictions.
5. Click **"Create"**.
6. Copy the generated API key and use it as the value for `PTERO_CLIENT_TOKEN` in your PTBot configuration.

> **Note:** Keep your API key secret! Anyone with this key can control your servers via PTBot.
